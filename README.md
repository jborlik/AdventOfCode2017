# AdventOfCode2017
Python code to solve daily puzzles of http://adventofcode.com/2017

Code is tested with Python 3.6.3 (Anaconda distribution) on Win10.  Developed with VSCode.

## Days
* Day 1:  Simple iteration
* Day 2:  Use itertools for permutations and divmod function
* Day 3:  Part 1 cleverly used insight into wrapped squares, part 2 brute forced arrays
* Day 4:  More itertools to find matches of words in a passphrase, part 1 unsorted part 2 sorted
* Day 5:  Simple rules to move up and down a stack
* Day 6:  "Reallocate" values by looping, looking for previous states.  I stored and recognized previous states by combining into strings.  Part 2 was effectively solved, which maybe means there is a clever solution for Part 1 that didn't require the whole thing.
* Day 7:  Create tree given specification of node name + children names.  Used classes, and _dictionary comprehensions_.
* Day 8:  Iteration over rules to increment registers.  Dictionaries.
* Day 9:  Iterate through long string to remove "garbage" and count group depths
* Day 10:  Creating a hash algorithm, based upon reversing sections of a ring-array.  Interesting, if maddening in its details.
* Day 11:  Follow instructions to walk along a hex grid.  Fun!  Red Blob Games blog posting was _very helpful_:  https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/
